# INL STEM Outreach Project Wiki
This is a wiki for educators to learn and troubleshoot how to use the STEM outreach project apps and VR headsets in thier classroom.

## About the VR Tours

### The Advanced Test Reactor
The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at Idaho National Laboratory, located 47 miles west of Idaho Falls, is the world's leading nuclear test reactor. It provides essential testing capabilities for military, federal, university, and industry partners, supporting U.S. and international nuclear research efforts. ATR's unique cloverleaf core design allows for multiple simultaneous experiments under different conditions, making it the only U.S. reactor capable of large-volume, high-flux neutron irradiation. It supports national security by testing for the U.S. Navy’s nuclear propulsion program, advances nuclear energy by improving reactor designs and testing new fuels, and facilitates collaborative research. ATR also produces important isotopes like medical grade cobalt-60 for cancer treatment and plutonium-238 for NASA’s space missions. Regular core overhauls and upgrades ensure its long-term operation. Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2017, ATR remains a vital asset for nuclear research and development.

### The Hot Fuel Cell Examination Facility
The Hot Fuel Examination Facility (HFEF) at Idaho National Laboratory is a place where scientists study how nuclear fuel and materials work after they have been used in a reactor. It is located at the Materials and Fuels Complex. It features the largest inert atmosphere hot cell in the U.S., enabling remote handling and detailed examination of highly irradiated samples. HFEF supports the development of safer and more efficient fuel designs through capabilities like laser puncture and gas collection, precision gamma scanning, and high-temperature testing in the Fuel Accident Condition Simulator (FACS). Additionally, it houses the Neutron Radiography Reactor for neutron imaging and supports fuel refabrication for testing in the TREAT facility.
